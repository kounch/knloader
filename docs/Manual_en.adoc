== Description

Do you have a ZX Spectrum Next, but you are tired to remember which is the best option to launch your programs? knloader to the rescue!

This a set of NextBASIC programs which you can configure to remember, and then use, your preferred way to launch other programs (Next/+3e Mode, 128K mode, USR 0, etc.). As a bonus, you can put some images (like cassette covers or loading screens).

This program is not a replacement for the incoportaded Browser, nor offers any other function than to launch other programs.

== Requirements

=== Download

A ZIP file with the latest version is available following https://github.com/kounch/knloader/releases/latest[this link]

=== Software Requirements

- *NextZXOS (version 1.3.2)*. Docs, downloads, etc. [here](https://www.specnext.com/latestdistro/)

<<<

== Installation

Create `knloader.bdt` file (see below for more instructions).

Copy `knloader.bas`, `knlauncher` and `knloader.bdt` to any place in your SD card.

<<<

== Use

Use the browser or command line to navigate to the folder where `knloader.bas`, `knlauncher` and `knloader.bdt` are. Load `knloader.bas`.

On first run, cache files will be created from the data inside database file `knloader.bdt`. This has to be done only once, or after any changes are made to the database file.

The main interface shows a list of the programs found in the database file.

Press X to exit the program.

Press H to show some help.

== Database file format

The main database is stored in a text file (ANSI encoding).

The first line must be the base path where to start looking for programs (for example: `/games`). It's length cannot exceed 128 characters.

Starting from line 2, each line must have the following format:

`Program Name`,`Loading Mode`,`<Directory>`,`File`,`<Image File>`

*`Program Name`*: Name to show in the interface (maximum 22 characters)

*`Loading Mode`*: A number indicating how to load the program file. Must be one of these:

    0  - 3DOS
    1  - TAP
    2  - TZX (fast)
    3  - DSK (AUTOBOOT)
    4  - TAP (USR 0)
    5  - TZX (USR0 - Fast)
    6  - TAP (Next)
    7  - TZX (Next - Fast)
    8  - DSK (Custom Boot)
    9  - TAP (PI Audio)
    10 - TZX
    11 - TAP (USR 0 - PI Audio)
    12 - TZX (USR 0)
    13 - TAP (PI Audio - Next)
    14 - TZX (Next)
    15 - NEX
    16 - Snapshot

*`Directory`*: Subdirectory where file (optionally) and image file are located (maximum 64 characters)

*`File`*: Name of the file to execute (maximum 64 characters)

*`Image File`*: (Optional) Name (maximum 64 characters) of a full screen image file to show behind the program listing. It can be in SCR, SLR, SHC, SL2 or BMP format.

<<<

== Notes

This program creates a preferences file named `opts.tmp` inside the same folder where `knloader.bas` is installed.

It also creates a variable number of cache files inside `/tmp/knloader`. This is necessary to speed up the program execution and overcome RAM limitations for large database files. However, if the database file is not changed, these will become read only on all subsequent executions.
